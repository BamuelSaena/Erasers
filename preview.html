      <h3>Blarbara</h3>
        <p>I bought my little timmy this eraser for his birthday, and he loves it.
          He was very excited to get this, since heard about from his cool friends that are cool and are up high in the social hierarchy of the school.
          He even tried to erase me! I give this product a 5/5 stars</p>
      <h3>Jonathan Hunt</h3>
        <p> When I got this eraser, I became the collest dude in the office.
        Everybody was like "wooahhh dude thats a rad eraser you got there, wherd you get it."
        Not only is the eraser very cool, but its lasted me forever.
        I've been working at this job for 17 years now, and I'm still the coolest guy around.</p>
      <h3>Jeff Jefferson</h3>
        <p>DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT< IT DOES NOT MEET SAFETY STANDARDS. 
         THE PRODUCTION FACTORY IS RUN BY CHILDREN FORCED TO DO LABOR. 
         THERE IS A HIGH LEAD CONTENT WITHIN THESE ERASERS.
         DO NOT BUY, I REPEAT DO NOT BUY </p>
      <h3>Mam Mammerson</h3>
        <p> I bought this nice little eraser for my boy jan-o-than.
          He loves trying to eat it and using it to do his math homework while e is in the hospital.
          When I got him this eraser, he mystrioursly got sick with an unknown bacteria, but its probably unrelated to this purchase.
          Hes also has got a lot more attention in the hospital since he has got this eraser. 
          This eraser is the best thing that has ever happened to jan-o-than</p>
